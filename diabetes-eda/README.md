#  Diabetes Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

##  Project Overview
This project explores a diabetes dataset using Python to understand data quality,
feature distributions, and relationships associated with diabetes diagnosis.

The goal is to demonstrate a clean, structured EDA workflow suitable for data analyst roles.

---

##  Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Diabetes Dataset)
- Records: 1000
- Features: 9 numerical variables including glucose, BMI, insulin, and age
- Target variable: `Diagnosis` (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

---

##  Key Steps Performed
- Data loading and inspection
- Missing value and duplicate checks
- Data cleaning and imputation
- Distribution analysis
- Feature comparison by diagnosis
- Correlation analysis
- Insight generation

---

##  Key Insights
- Diabetic patients tend to show slightly higher glucose levels and age.
- BMI distributions are similar across diagnosis groups.
- Insulin shows high variability and skewness.
- Most features show weak linear correlation with diabetes diagnosis.

##  Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab
